# This is a list of the names of the virus scanning engines, along with the
# filename of the command or script to run to invoke each one.
# Three fields:
#  1.  Name of virus scanner as known by Baruwa. Do not change this.
#  2.  Location of -wrapper script. You should not need to change this.
#  3.  Installation directory of virus scanner. This does not usually include
#      any "bin" directory in the path to the scanner program itself.
# You can test a -wrapper script with a command like this:
#      /usr/libexec/Baruwa/f-secure-wrapper /opt/f-secure/fsav /tmp
# That command will attempt to scan /tmp using F-Secure. If it works you
# should see some sensible output. If it fails, you will probably just see
# an error message such as "Command not found" or similar.
