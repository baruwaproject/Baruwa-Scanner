Rulesets
========

This directory is where you should put ruleset files, with filenames ending
in ".rules" wherever possible as it makes life easier for me.

All blank lines are ignored, and comments start with "#" and continue to the
end of the line, like this:
	# This line is just a comment

Other than that, every line is a rule and looks like one of these examples:
	From:	john.doe@domain.com			yes
	From:	spammer@domain.com and To: abuse@you	no

As you can see, each rule has 3 fields:
	1. Direction (or "Virus:")
	2. Pattern to match
	3. Result value (or values)
or 6 fields:
	1. Direction 1 (or "Virus:")
	2. Pattern to match
	3. The literal word "and"
	4. Direction 2 (or "Virus:")
	5. Pattern to match
	6. Result value (or values)

1. Direction should be one of the following:
     From:      - Matches when the message is from a matching address
     To:        - Matches when the message is to a matching address
     FromOrTo:  - Matches when the message is from or to a matching address
     FromAndTo: - Matches when the message is from and to a matching address
     Virus:     - Matches when the message contains a virus whose report
                  contains the "address" somewhere in it

   The syntax of these is very loosely defined. Any word containing
   "from", any word containing "to", any word containing "from" and "to"
   (in either order), and any word containing "and" will work just fine.
   You can put them in upper or lower case, it doesn't matter. And any
   additional punctuation will be ignored.

   This specifies the whether the rule should be matched against
   the sender's address (or IP address), or the recipient's address.

2. The pattern describes what messages should match this rule.
   Some examples are:
	user@sub.domain.com	# Individual address
	user@*			# 1 user at any domain
	*@sub.domain.com	# Any user at 1 domain
	*@*.domain.com		# Any user at any sub-domain of "domain.com"
	*@domain.com		# Any user at 1 specific domain
	/pattern/		# Any address matching this Perl regular
				# expression
	192.168.21.		# Any SMTP client IP address in this network
	192.168.21		# Any SMTP client IP address in this network
	192.168.21.0/255.255.255.0 # Any SMTP client IP address in this network
	192.168.21.0/24		# Any SMTP client IP address in this network
	/pattern-with-no-letters/ # Any SMTP client IP address matching this
				  # Perl regular expression
	/^192\.168\.1[4567]\./	# Any SMTP client IP address in the networks
				# 192.168.14 - 192.168.17
	host:mail.example.com	# Any hostname
	host:example.com	# Any domain name
	host:mail*.example.com	# Any hostname or domain name with wildcards
	host:mail*.exam*ple.com	# Another wildcard example
	host:/pattern/		# Any hostname matching this Perl regular
				# expression
	host:			# Any IP address that has no hostname
	host:_SPOOFED_		# Any IP address whose DNS records don't match
	*@*			# Default value
	default			# Default value
   You should be able to do just about anything with that.

3. The result value is what you could have put in the entry in the main
   baruwa.conf file had you not given the filename of a ruleset instead.

You can only test a maximum of 2 conditions using the "and" operator. It must
not appear more than once in each rule.


See the file EXAMPLES for a few ideas on how to do things with this system.
