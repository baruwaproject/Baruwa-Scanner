# These are attacks that look like a genuine email message from your bank,

# will be asked to type in personal information such as your account number
# or credit card details.
# Except it is not the real bank's web site at all, it is a very good copy
# of it run by thieves who want to steal your personal information or
# credit card details.
# These can be spotted because the real address of the link in the message
# is not the same as the text that appears to be the link.

# Attachment Filename Checking
# ----------------------------
#

# There are now 2 sets of configurations for filename and filetype checking.
# One set applies to files found within attachments which are archives,
# their names start with "Archives:".
# The other set of configuration options applies to normal attachments,
# their names do *not* start with "Archives:".

# What sort of attachments are considered to be archives?
# You may well consider, for example, zip and rar files to be archives, but
# maybe TNEF files to not be archives as they are really just another way
# of supplying attachments that is only used by Microsoft Exchange and Outlook.
# This is a space-separated list of the types which are treated as archives.
# Valid keywords within this are:
#       zip  -- Zip files and Microsoft Office 2007 documents
#       rar  -- Rar archives
#       uu   -- UU-encoded files
#       ole  -- Microsoft ".doc" and ".xls" and ".ppt" files
#       tnef -- "winmail.dat" files created by Microsoft Exchange or Outlook
Archives Are = zip rar ole

#
# Set where to find the attachment filename ruleset.
# The structure of this file is explained elsewhere, but it is used to
# accept or reject file attachments based on their name, regardless of
# whether they are infected or not.
#
# This can also point to a ruleset, but the ruleset filename must end in
# ".rules" so that Baruwa can determine if the filename given is
# a ruleset or not!
Filename Rules = %rules-dir%/filename.rules

# Set where to find the attachment filetype ruleset.
# The structure of this file is explained elsewhere, but it is used to
# accept or reject file attachments based on their content as determined
# by the "file" command, regardless of whether they are infected or not.
#
# This can also point to a ruleset, but the ruleset filename must end in
# ".rules" so that Baruwa can determine if the filename given is
# a ruleset or not!
#
# To disable this feature, set this to just "Filetype Rules =" or set
# the location of the file command to a blank string.
Filetype Rules = %rules-dir%/filetype.rules

# These are the equivalent of the settings above, except they apply to
# files which are contained within "archives", as defined by the
# "Archives Are" setting at the top of this section.
# They can all be rulesets.
Archives: Filename Rules = %etc-dir%/archives.filename.rules.conf
Archives: Filetype Rules = %etc-dir%/archives.filetype.rules.conf

# In the "Filename Rules" and "Filetype Rules" rule files, you can
# say that you want particular attachment names or types to be "disarmed"
# by being renamed. See the sample files for examples of this.
#
# The "rename" rules in filetype.rules.conf rename attachments that match
# the rule according to this setting, where the string "__FILENAME__" will
# be replaced with the attachment's original filename.
#
# In filename.rules.conf, it is a little more complex. They can work just
# like the filetype rules.conf version explained in the previous paragraph,
# or else the "rename" instruction can also supply the replacement text.
# For example, a rule starting
# rename to .txt	\.reg$	.....
# will match all attachment filenames ending in ".reg" and replace the
# ".reg" with ".txt".
#
# The "rename" rules change the filename of the attachment as described
# above, so that either
# (a) the user cannot simply double-click on the attachment, but must save
#     it then rename it back to its original name; only then can they
#     double-click on the file.
# OR
# (b) the action taken when the user double-clicks on the file will be
#     changed. In the "reg"/"txt" example above, the file will be opened
#     for editing rather than immediately merged into the user's Windows
#     Registry, which could have had disastrous consequences.
#
# This provides a simple safeguard so that users have to consciously
# think about what they are doing, and do not accidentally take actions
# they would probably regret. In some situations this is better than
# just denying the file completely, as the user can still see the attachment
# they were sent.
#
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.

# SpamAssassin
# ------------
#

# Do you want to find spam using the "SpamAssassin" package?
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Use SpamAssassin = yes

# SpamAssassin is not very fast when scanning huge messages, so messages
# bigger than this value will be truncated to this length for SpamAssassin
# testing. The original message will not be affected by this. This value
# is a good compromise as very few spam messages are bigger than this.
#
# Now for the options:
# 1) <length of data in bytes>
# 2) <length of data in bytes> trackback
# 3) <length of data in bytes> continue <max extra bytes allowed>
#
# 1) Put in a simple number.
#    This will be the simple cut-off point for messages that are larger than
#    this number.
# 2) Put in a number followed by 'trackback'.
#    Once the size limit is reached, Baruwa reverses towards the start
#    of the message, until it hits a line that is blank. The message passed
#    to SpamAssassin is truncated there. This stops any part-images being
#    passed to SpamAssassin, and so avoids rules which trigger on this.
# 3) Put in a number followed by 'continue' followed by another number.
#    Once the size limit is reached, Baruwa continues adding to the data
#    passed to SpamAssassin, until at most the 2nd number of bytes have been
#    added looking for a blank line. This tries to complete the image data
#    that has been started when the 1st number of bytes has been reached,
#    while imposing a limit on the amount that can be added (to avoid attacks).
#
# If all this confuses you, just leave it alone at "40k" as that is good.

# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Spam Score = yes

# Many naive spammers send out the same message to lots of people.
# These messages are very likely to have roughly the same SpamAssassin score.
# For extra speed, cache the SpamAssassin results for the messages
# being processed so that you only call SpamAssassin once for all of the
# messages.
# If you set this to "no" then the entire SpamAssassin Cache Database File
# is not used, along with its requirement for SQLite.
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset.
Cache SpamAssassin Results = yes

# The SpamAssassin cache uses a database file which needs to be writable
# by the Baruwa "Run As User". This file will be created and setup for
# you automatically when Baruwa is started.
# Note: If you move the "Incoming Work Dir" then you should move this too.
SpamAssassin Cache Database File = /var/lib/baruwa/scanner/SpamAssassin.cache.db

# If you are using the Bayesian statistics engine on a busy server,
# you may well need to force a Bayesian database rebuild and expiry
# at regular intervals. This is measures in seconds.
# 1 day = 86400 seconds.
# To disable this feature set this to 0.
# Note: If you enable this feature, set "bayes_auto_expire 0" in
#       spam.assasssin.prefs.conf which you will find in the same
#       directory as this file.
Rebuild Bayes Every = 0

# The Bayesian database rebuild and expiry may take a 2 or 3 minutes
# to complete. During this time you can either wait, or simply
# disable SpamAssassin checks until it has completed.
Wait During Bayes Rebuild = no

#
# What to do with spam
# --------------------
#

# This is a list of actions to take when a message is spam.
# It can be any combination of the following:
#    deliver                 - deliver the message as normal
#    delete                  - delete the message
#    store                   - store the message in the (spam) quarantine
#    store-nonspam           - store the message in the non-spam quarantine
#    store-spam              - store the message in the spam quarantine
#    store-<directory-path>  - store the message in the <directory-path>
#    forward user@domain.com - forward a copy of the message to user@domain.com
#                              See the note below about the keywords that
#                              can be used.
#    striphtml               - convert all in-line HTML content to plain text.
#                              You need to specify "deliver" as well for the
#                              message to reach the original recipient.
#    attachment              - Convert the original message into an attachment
#                              of the message. This means the user has to take
#                              an extra step to open the spam, and stops "web
#                              bugs" very effectively.
#    header "name: value"    - Add the header
#                                name: value
#                              to the message. name must not contain any spaces.
#                              The "value" may contain the magic keyword "_TO_"
#                              anywhere in it. _TO_ will be replaced by a
#                              comma-separated list of the original recipients
#                              of the message. This is very useful if you just
#                              forward the message to a new address and don't
#                              use the "deliver" action, as otherwise the list
#                              of the original recipients may be lost.
#
# "forward" keywords
# ==================
# In an email address specified in the "forward" action, several keywords can
# be used which will be substituted with various properties of the message:
# _FROMUSER_   The left-hand side of the address of the sender.
# _FROMDOMAIN_ The right-hand side of the address of the sender.
# _TOUSER_     The left-hand side of each of the recipients in turn.
# _TODOMAIN_   The right-hand side of each of the recipients in turn.
# _DATE_       The date the message was received by Baruwa.
# _HOUR_       The hour the message was received by Baruwa.
# This means that you can forward messages to email addresses which show the
# original recipients of the message, which could be very useful when
# delivering into spam archive management systems.
#
# The default value I have set here enables Thunderbird to automatically
# handle spam when set to trust the "SpamAssassin" headers.
#
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, in which case the filename
# must end in ".rule" or ".rules".
#Spam Actions = store forward anonymous@ecs.soton.ac.uk

# This means that you can forward messages to email addresses which show the

#
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, in which case the filename
# must end in ".rule" or ".rules".
Non Spam Actions = %rules-dir%/nonspam.actions.rules

# This next setting is very powerful. It allows you to adjust the list of
# actions taken on a message by adding or removing any action or actions,
# depending on what SpamAssassin rules it matched.
#
# The setting consists of a comma-separated list of
# SA_RULENAME=>action,action,...
# pairs, where 'SA_RULENAME' is the name of any SpamAssassin rule (or
# meta-rule), and 'action' is the name of any of the actions listed above
# the 'Spam Actions' configuration setting or the word "not-" preceding any
# of the action names.
# Preceding the action name with "not-" as in "not-deliver" or "not-forward
# user@domain.com" will cause the action to be removed from the list of
# actions that would normally be taken on this message.
#
# All of the keywords available in the "forward" action also work here.
#
# You can specify a comma-separated list of actions if you need more than 1
# action per rule.
#
# Example: Setting this to
# SpamAssassin Rule Actions = FROM_BOSS_WIFE=>not-forward secretary@domain.com
# would result in mail from the boss's wife not being forwarded to the boss's
# secretary, which would be useful if the non-spam actions for the message
# included forwarding to the boss's secretary.
#
# You can also trigger actions on the spam score of the message. You can
# compare the spam score with a number and cause this to trigger an action.
# For example, instead of a SA_RULENAME you can specify
# SpamScore>number or SpamScore>=number or SpamScore==number or
# SpamScore<number or SpamScore<=number
# where "number" is the threshold value you are comparing it against.
# So you could have a rule/action pair that looks like
#                  SpamScore>25=>delete
# This would cause all messages with a total spam score of more than 25 to be
# deleted. You can use this to implement multiple levels of spam actions in
# addition to the normal spam actions and the high-scoring spam actions.
#
# Combining this with a ruleset makes it even more powerful, as different
# recipients and/or senders can have different sets of rules applied to them.
#
# This can also be the filename of a ruleset, in which case the filename
# must end in ".rule" or ".rules".

# message is mis-tagged as spam when it shouldn't have been.

# You may also need to use these if you have installed SpamAssassin
# somewhere other than the default location.
#

# SpamAssassin creates lots of temporary files as it works on messages.
# For speed, these should be created in a location mounted using tmpfs if
# you have it. Baruwa will attempt to mkdir it if necessary, so no
# special scripts are needed to set it up before running Baruwa.
# Note: If you move the "Incoming Work Dir" then you should move this too.
SpamAssassin Temporary Dir = /var/spool/baruwa/SpamAssassin-Temp

# The per-user files (bayes, auto-whitelist, user_prefs) are looked
# for here and in ~/.spamassassin/. Note the files are mutable.
SpamAssassin User State Dir = /var/spool/baruwa/spamassassin

# This setting is useful if SpamAssassin is installed in an unusual place,
# e.g. /opt/baruwa. The install prefix is used to find some fallback
# directories if neither of the following two settings work.
# If this is set then it adds to the list of places that are searched;

# /etc/mail/spamassassin, and maybe others.
# Be careful of setting this: it may mean the spam.assassin.prefs.conf file
# is missed out, you will need to insert a soft-link with "ln -s" to link

#
# Database SQL Configuration Settings
#
# This section allows you to over-ride any setting in this file or its
# related "include"d files with a setting or a ruleset in an SQL database.

# If you wish to read settings from a database or any other DBI-compatible
# data source, then this value should be set to the DBI data source name.
#
# This value is required for all of the database functions to work; if it
# is not supplied or is invalid, then all of the database functions will be
# disabled.  See the Perl DBI documentation for all available options.
#
# Example: DB DSN = DBI:DriverName:database=DataBaseName;host=Hostname;port=Port
DB DSN = DBI:Pg:database=baruwa

# Baruwa local sqlite DSN
# Example DBI:SQLite:dbname=/var/lib/baruwa/data/db/baruwa2.db
Local DB DSN = DBI:SQLite:dbname=/var/lib/baruwa/data/db/baruwa2.db

# Optional username to use to connect to the data source defined by DB DSN.
DB Username = baruwa

# Optional password to use to connect to the data source defined by DB DSN.
DB Password = password

# This should be a valid SQL statement that returns a single row of data from
# your data source in integer format. This value is periodically checked every
# 15 minutes and if it is numerically greater than the previously retrieved
# value then the Baruwa child will exit and reload its configuration.
#
# This setting is required for all database functions to work; if it is not
# defined or the SQL is invalid then all database functions will be disabled.
#
# Example:  SELECT value FROM config WHERE option='confserialnumber'
SQL Serial Number = SELECT MAX(value) AS confserialnumber FROM quickpeek WHERE internal='confserialnumber'

# This should be a valid SQL statement that takes two placeholder arguments
# and returns a single row and column of data.  The first placeholder will
# contain the 'external' variable representation of the Baruwa setting
# being looked-up and the second placeholder will contain the hostname of the
# host that is requesting the data.
#
# This setting is required for all database functions to work; if it is not
# defined or the SQL is invalid then all database functions will be disabled.
#
# Exmaple: SQL Quick Peek = SELECT value FROM config WHERE external = ? AND host = ?
SQL Quick Peek = SELECT value FROM quickpeek WHERE LOWER(external) = ? AND (hostname = ? OR hostname='default') LIMIT 1

# This should be a valid SQL statement that has a single placeholder argument
# and must return two columns and one row per configuration setting.
# The placeholder will contain the hostname of the host requsting the data.
# The first column must return the 'internal' representation of the setting
# and the second column must return the value that should be assigned.
# If the value contains 'foobar.customi[zs]e' then the value is presumed to
# be a database ruleset and will cause the defined 'SQL Ruleset' statement to
# be run and will use 'foobar' as the ruleset name to retrieve the ruleset.
#
# This setting is required for all database functions to work; if it is not
# defined or the SQL is invalid then all database functions will be disabled.
#
# Exmaple: SQL Config = SELECT option, value FROM config WHERE host=?
SQL Config = SELECT internal, value, hostname FROM quickpeek WHERE hostname=? OR hostname='default'

# This should be a valid SQL statement that has a single placeholder argument
# and must return two columns and one or more rows.  The first column must be
# a numeric starting at 1 and in ascending order and the second column should
# be the rule string.  The placeholder will contain the ruleset name.
#
# Example: SQL Ruleset = SELECT num, rule FROM ruleset WHERE rulesetname=? ORDER BY num ASC
SQL Ruleset = SELECT row_number, ruleset AS rule FROM msrulesets WHERE name=?

# This should be a valid SQL statement that returns a single column and one
# or more rows.  Each row that is returned is pushed into an array and joined
# into a string separated by newlines and then passed into the SpamAssassin API
# using the {post_config_text} attribute. See the SpamAssassin API for details.
# The returned rows should be valid SpamAssassin configuration settings that
# will be processed by SpamAssassin after it has read all of normal configuration.
# Any errors will therefore be reported by SpamAssassin and will show up by
# running 'baruwa --lint' or 'baruwa --debug-sa'.
#
# Example:  SQL SpamAssassin Config = SELECT text FROM sa_config
SQL SpamAssassin Config =

# If enabled; this will log lots of debugging output to STDERR and to syslog
# to help pinpoint any errors in the returned database values and will show
# exactly what is being processed as the data is being loaded.
SQL Debug = no

#
# Sphinx Configuration settings
#
# These settings are used by Baruwa's Logging Modules Sphinx indexer
#
# This should be an IP address of the Sphinx Search server
# Defaults to 127.0.0.1
# Example: Sphinx Host = 127.0.0.1
Sphinx Host = 127.0.0.1

# This should be a port number of the Sphinx Search server
# Defaults to 9306
# Example: Sphinx Port = 9306
Sphinx Port = 9306

#
# Advanced Settings
# -----------------
#
# Don't bother changing anything below this unless you really know
# what you are doing, or else if Baruwa has complained about
# your "Minimum Code Status" setting.
#

# When trying to work out the value of configuration parameters which are
# using a ruleset, this controls the behaviour when a rule is checking the
# "To:" addresses.
# If this option is set to "yes", then the following happens when checking
# the ruleset:

# When working out from IP address the message was sent from,
# no or 0  ==> use the SMTP client address, ie. the address of the system
#              talking to the Baruwa server. This is the normal setting.
# yes or 1 ==> use the first IP address contained in the first "Received:"
#              header at the top of the email message's headers.
# Any number > 1 ==> use the first IP address contained in the n-th
#                    "Received:" header starting from the top of the email
#                    message's headers.
# Users of BarricadeMX should note that this setting will always be forced

# This is very useful when you are injecting mail into a Baruwa server

# When attempting delivery of outgoing messages, should we do it in the
